// TWO THINGS DECIDE WHETHER A MICROPHONE EXISTS HERE, and they are independent:
//
//  1. **The bridge published a provider.** `/api/config` carries `stt` only when the operator ran

//     Absent draws NO button — not a disabled one. `available: false` is the other case: a provider
//     that exists and cannot serve right now, which DOES draw a disabled button carrying the
//     bridge's own `reason`, because the operator can fix that and needs to be told what to fix.
//  2. **This browser can actually record.** A `MediaRecorder`, a `getUserMedia`, and a secure
//     context. Over plain HTTP (a tailnet URL without `tailscale serve`) `navigator.mediaDevices` is
//     simply not there, and #115 shipped without this check — the button rendered and did nothing.
//     A control that provably cannot work is worse than no control, so this hides the button
//     entirely rather than disabling it: there is no operator action on the phone that fixes it.
