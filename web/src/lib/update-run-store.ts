// ── ONE POLL FOR THE WHOLE UPDATE SUBJECT ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// ONE poll for that subject, and not one per surface: `.adr/0044`, which carries the dated
// incidents the split produced.
//
// The Updates card and the update screen both need the same three things: the run record, the crew
// census and the preflight. The card used to own all of it — a mount read of `GET /api/update/check`,
// a re-read on every settle, and a `setInterval` on the standby door — and the sheet cannot own any
// of it, because it is mounted in `App.tsx` OUTSIDE the router (see `components/update-screen.tsx`)
// and therefore has no route loader data and no `CrewProvider`.
//
// Two surfaces each running that machinery would poll the standby door twice whenever both are
// mounted, which is the one route that is answered by a SECOND listener on a second port during the
// restart gap. So the machinery lives here, once, ref-counted by its subscribers, and both surfaces
// read it through `useSyncExternalStore`.
//
// ── WHY THIS STORE POLLS THE FRONT DOOR AT ALL ───────────────────────────────
// The card never had to: the snapshot poll goes hot while a run is in flight (`hooks/use-polling.ts`)
// and carries the run record, and the card reads the snapshot through the router. The sheet has no
// snapshot. So the store reads `GET /api/update/check` on its own while a run is moving, and the card
// hands it every snapshot it sees ({@link noteSnapshotRun}) so the two sources reconcile here rather
// than on two screens.
//
// ── THE RESTART GAP IS NOT AN OUTAGE ─────────────────────────────────────────
// A failed read changes nothing on screen and is tried again. The bridge is genuinely gone during
// `restarting` — that is the update working — and `GET /standby/update` (CREW_PROTOCOL.md §18.15) is
// the one reader that still answers in that window.
//
// ── A RUN THAT MOVES ONLY THE MEMBERS RIDES THE STATUS, NOT A RECORD (M32) ───
// A peers-only run writes no record on the lead, so none of the three run sources above carries it.
// Its legs ride the status instead (`peers`, `settledAt`, `peersTo`), and both the snapshot poll and
// this store's own `GET /api/update/check` read that status. So the store takes the legs from BOTH
// and keeps the LATER reading: the two are one composer on the bridge, read at two moments, so the
// later reading is simply the later reading. "Later" is when the snapshot ARRIVED, and when this
// store's own read was ASKED: that read is fetched once when the first reader subscribes and answers
// whenever it answers, and an answer to a question asked before the crew moved must never overwrite
// a poll that has already seen it move.
//
// Nothing new polls for it. The snapshot poll already goes hot while the crew moves
// (`hooks/use-polling.ts`), and `routes/root.tsx` hands every snapshot over. Which of those legs are
// a crew-only run is the reducer's decision, not this file's.
//
// ONE BEAT IS NOBODY'S, and this store fills it. The confirm's 202 comes back before the lead's first
// sweep has folded the run it just began, and the bridge sends no legs at all until then. A device
// that has just asked for a peers-only run would see the PREVIOUS run's settled legs, or nothing, and
// the takeover would arrive one poll late, or flash last run's failure first. So the card calls
// {@link noteCrewRunBegun}, and until the first legs of the NEW run arrive, for at most
// {@link CREW_BEGUN_MS}, the store answers "a crew run with no legs yet" and sets aside the reading it
// held at the tap. That reading is the old run's, and the bridge's own `begin` just cleared it.

 * reached `done` in six seconds and this store stopped polling before the crew phase had begun.

 * `X-Crew-Preflight: fresh`, and a member whose banked verdict is unknown is refused its turn
 * (`bridge/crew/follow.ts`, `eligible`). So a phone that stops asking can leave a member sitting on
 * `waiting` with nothing on either machine saying why. Measured on the real crew: the lead granted
 * at 13:50:23, minibuch was told at 13:52:48, and did the work in four seconds.
 *
 * `hooks/use-polling.ts` already reads the subject this way (`runInFlight(...) || crewMoving(...)`).
 * This is the same question, asked of the legs this store has already reconciled — and it must be
 * asked of THOSE, not of `snapshot.check`, because `check` is refreshed by the very poll this
