/**
 * THE UNSEEN MARK: a filled SQUARE in full ink, meaning "a reply is waiting that you have not
 * opened" (`isUnseen()`, lib/triage.ts).
 *
 * A square because no status mark is one: blocked is a triangle, working a half-filled circle, done
 * a disc, idle a ring (`StatusDot`). Colour is already spent on status (red, amber, green, grey), and
 * green already means done, so an unseen dot in any colour read as one more status, or, in white, as
 * nothing much. A different SHAPE says a different kind of fact, needs no colour, and so reads the
 * same in both themes and to a colour-blind eye. Chosen 2026-09-16 over a violet or sky-blue dot that
 * would have replaced the status dot; since issue 420 (2026-10-12) it is one of five shapes and no
 * longer the only one.
 *
 * It is drawn in the status marks' own 12px box: a 9px square with 1.5px corners, so its weight sits
 * beside a disc and a triangle, and it stays `text-foreground`, full ink, not a status colour. A
 * caller that needs a smaller slot passes its own `size-*`.
 *
 * `reserve` keeps the slot when the pane is seen, drawn invisible, so a row's name truncates at the
 * same width in both states and nothing shifts when the mark comes or goes (DESIGN.md's no-shift
 * rule). The words are for a screen reader only when the mark is drawn.
